                <h2>Introduction to React</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a component-based architecture that
                encourages reusability and modularity. With React, you can create encapsulated components that manage their
                own state and efficiently update the UI when data changes. One of React's key features is the virtual DOM,
                which enhances rendering performance by minimizing direct DOM manipulations.
            </p>
            <h3>React Features and Benefits</h3>
            <p>
                React offers a declarative syntax, making it easier to understand and maintain UI code. Its unidirectional
                data flow ensures predictable updates and helps prevent common UI bugs. React's extensive ecosystem and
                supportive community provide a wide range of tools, libraries, and resources for building robust
                applications.

                <h2>Components and Props</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                React applications are composed of components, which are reusable building blocks. Components encapsulate UI
                elements and behavior, allowing you to create modular and maintainable code. By using props, you can pass
                data from parent to child components, enabling dynamic and data-driven rendering.

                <code>Example code</code>
            </p>
            <h3>Component types:</h3>
            <li>Functional Components: In simple words, Functional components are javascript functions</li> 
            <li>Class Components</li>
            <li>Higher-Order Components</li>
            <li>Presentational Components</li>
            <li>Container components</li>
        </section>
    
        <section class="main-section" id="state">
            <header>
                <h2>State</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                Component state is used to manage data that can change over time and affect the component's behavior and
                rendering. You can update state using the `setState` method, triggering re-rendering and reflecting the
                updated data in the UI. Lifecycle methods provide opportunities to perform actions at specific points in a
                component's lifecycle, such as initialization, updates, and unmounting.

        <section class="main-section" id="hooks">
            <header>
                <h2>Hooks</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                Hooks are functions that allow you to use React features in functional components. `useState` enables you to
                add state to functional components, while `useEffect` lets you perform side effects in response to component
                changes. Other hooks, like `useContext` and custom hooks, provide advanced functionality for managing state,
                context, and logic.

        <section class="main-section" id="jsx_and_rendering">
            <header>
                <h2>JSX and Rendering</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write UI elements in a familiar
                HTML-like format within your JavaScript code. React's rendering process converts JSX elements into the
                actual DOM elements that are displayed in the browser. This makes it easier to visualize and understand the
                structure of your UI components.
                <code>Example code</code>
            </p>
        </section>
    
        
    <section class="main-section" id="conditional_rendering">
        <header>
            <h2>Conditional Rendering</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            Conditional rendering in React allows you to display different content based on certain conditions. You can use
            conditional statements and the ternary operator to control what gets rendered in your components. This is useful
            for showing or hiding elements, rendering fallback content, or responding to user interactions.
            <code>Example code</code>
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="lists">
        <header>
            <h2>Lists</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            When rendering lists of elements in React, you should use the `map` function to create an array of JSX elements.
            Each element in the array should have a unique "key" attribute, which helps React efficiently update the DOM
            when the list changes. Properly using keys improves performance and helps maintain component state.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="forms">
        <header>
            <h2>Forms</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            React provides a controlled approach to handling form elements and user events. You can use state to store form
            input values and update them through event handlers. By managing form data in this way, you can create
            interactive and dynamic forms while ensuring consistent and predictable behavior.
            <code>Example code</code>
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="routing">
        <header>
            <h2>Routing</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            React Router is a library that enables client-side routing in your React applications. It allows you to define
            different routes and map them to specific components. With React Router, you can create a multi-page experience
            within a single-page application, enabling smooth navigation and seamless user interactions.
            <code>Example code</code>
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="styling">
        <header>
            <h2>Styling</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            Styling in React can be achieved using CSS classes, inline styles, or CSS-in-JS libraries like
            styled-components. CSS-in-JS libraries enable you to write component-specific styles directly in your JavaScript
            code. This approach helps maintain a clear separation of concerns and allows for more modular and reusable
            styling.

    <section class="main-section" id="best_practices">
        <header>
            <h2>Best Practices</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            When working with React, following best practices can enhance your development process and improve the
            maintainability of your code. Consider structuring your components for reusability, optimizing performance
            through memoization, and adhering to consistent coding patterns. Regularly updating dependencies and staying
            informed about the latest React developments is also crucial.
